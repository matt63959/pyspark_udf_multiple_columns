# pyspark_udf_returning_multiple_columns
This is a simple example of how to create a udf(user defined function) in pyspark that return multiple columns,
or more precisely, that returns a structure that will be unpacked to form the columns that we want, beyond that it will show
different ways to pass multiple columns as parameters to the udf.
